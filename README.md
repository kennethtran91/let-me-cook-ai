## The Problem: "What Can I Make?" ü§î

We've all been there: staring into a fridge filled with a random assortment of ingredients, wondering, "What can I possibly cook with this?" This common dilemma often leads to:

-   **Food Waste:** Perfectly good ingredients are thrown away because we lack inspiration or a specific recipe.
-   **Unnecessary Spending:** We default to ordering takeout or buying more groceries when we could have used what we already have.
-   **Decision Fatigue:** The mental effort of planning a meal with limited options can be surprisingly draining.

Let Me Cook AI tackles this problem head-on by providing an instant, creative, and practical solution.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions ü§ñ

This application leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to act as your personal AI chef. Simply:

1.  **List Your Ingredients:** Enter the items you have on hand.
2.  **Specify a Cuisine (Optional):** If you're in the mood for something specific, like Italian or Asian, let the AI know.
3.  **Get Instant Recipes:** The app generates three distinct and creative recipe ideas, complete with a name, an enticing description, a list of ingredients with quantities, and clear, step-by-step instructions.

By bridging the gap between your ingredients and a finished meal, Let Me Cook AI helps you save money, reduce waste, and explore new culinary possibilities.

## üöÄ How to Build and Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or a compatible package manager).
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

While this project uses CDN-hosted dependencies for simplicity in this environment, a typical local setup would involve installing them via npm.

```bash
# In a standard Angular project, you would run:
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

The application requires your Google Gemini API key to function. This key is loaded from an environment variable.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
2.  Add your API key to the `.env` file in the following format:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key.

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

To view the application, you need to serve the `index.html` file. You can use a simple tool like `live-server` or the built-in server in your code editor (like VS Code's Live Server extension).

Because the project is set up with ES modules and a development server is assumed to handle environment variables, you would typically run a command like:

```bash
npm run start
```

The browser will open, and you'll be able to interact with the Let Me Cook application!
